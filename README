*Instructions for setting up the code test*

# Fork this repository.
# Clone the repository locally.
# bundle install
# Create the database
# Run migrations
# Load seed data (rake db:seed)
# Verify that the app runs and you can get to the index page.


*Code test details*

There are two models: patients and needs, with a habtm relation between them.
The goal of the test is to display a grid showing patients in the left column
and needs along the top (see below). Clicking in a cell should create a relation
between the patient and the need in the database. If successful, the cell should
display 'true' both immediately and after a page reload.

<pre>
          | Need1 | Need2 | Need 3 | ...
Patient 1 | true  |       | true   |
Patient 2 |       | true  |        |
Patient 3 |       | true  | true   |
Patient 4 | true  |       |        |
...
</pre>

The click should happen via a JQuery Ajax call, i.e. the page should not reload on a click.

*After completing the code, commit the changes and send me (Prista1) a pull request.*


*If time allows*
# Use CSS to style the grid to make it look good.
# Use HTML5/Canvas to display the need names slanted as in this image:
